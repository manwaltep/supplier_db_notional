### What goes in the procurement plan

If you already have a business case, you may be able to draw a lot of the information you need from it. If a business case hasn't been written yet but your agency requires one, you might be able to combine the two in the same document.

### 1. Key project information
Include:

- your objectives and how you plan to achieve them
- an outline of what's being procured and the costs involved
- how the planned approach meets the Principles of Government Procurement (eg transparent, fair to all suppliers or providers, will get the right supplier or provider and the best outcome) and the Government Procurement Rules, if applicable
- governance arrangements and approvals processes
- key stakeholders and your plan for engaging with them
- links to your agency's procurement strategy.

### 2. Sourcing plan
Include:

- the type of procurement approach you'll use (eg open process or direct sourcing)
- how suppliers or providers and their proposals will be evaluated and what due diligence you'll conduct
- a written document detailing your strategy for approaching the supplier or provider community.

### 3. Exclusions and exceptions
Include:

- a record of any exclusions or exemptions to the Government Procurement Rules, giving specific justification for the approach
- evidence of an approved formal exemption from an independent senior manager if your proposed approach proposes a departure from your agencyâ€™s own procurement policy.
- Link to Rule 12 and Rule 14.

### 4. Contract information
Include:

- a description of the contract that will be used
- how the contract will be delivered and its completion date
- how the contract will be managed during delivery.

### 5. Risks and probity
Include:

- the risks associated with the project and how they will be managed.
- how the probity process will be managed.

### 6. Timetable
Include:

- a realistic step-by-step timetable for the procurement process
- sign-offs, responsibilities, and approvals.
